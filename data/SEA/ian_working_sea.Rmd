This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

#Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
sea <- read.csv("data/SEA/sea_may_2010.csv")

```

#Stitch every year of SEA data together
```{r}
sea_all_years <- tibble()

for (year in 2011:2021){
  next_year <- read_csv(str_c("data/SEA/sea_may_", year, ".csv"))
  next_year <- next_year %>% 
    mutate(YEAR = year)
  sea_all_years <- sea_all_years %>% bind_rows(next_year)
}

sea_all_years %>% 
  write_csv("data/DC/dc_all_years.csv")




```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
